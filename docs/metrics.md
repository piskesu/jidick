At the same time kernel will also add 1 to TcpExtListenDrops. When a TCP socket is in LISTEN state, and kernel need to drop a packet, kernel would always add 1 to TcpExtListenDrops. So increase TcpExtListenOverflows would let TcpExtListenDrops increasing at the same time, but TcpExtListenDrops would also increase without TcpExtListenOverflows increasing, e.g. a memory allocation fail would also let TcpExtListenDrops increase | count      | host,container | proc fs                                                                               |
